Many companies now offer flexible and hybrid working arrangements, which allows their employees to work from locations other than their designated office. Since workplaces have transitioned to a hybrid model, many have re-organised their offices so that employees do not have designated desks to allow for more flexibility. The downside of this is that there can be times when the office is busier than usual and there aren't enough desks for everybody there. If someone comes to the office, hoping there will be a desk available, time can be wasted while they try to find a desk and they may even have to go home and work remotely.

Other problems that can occur as a result of the hybrid model are that companies may find their office space is being under-utilised. This could prompt them to divert funds elsewhere if the expense of paying for office space, including furniture, utility bills, equipment etc is deemed unneccesary. There are some business however, that are unable to move to a fully remote operation (e.g. manufacturing, health care etc). These businesses may want visibility of how much the office is being utilised and/or whether employees are coming into the office in accordance with their policy.

I have chosen to create an app which companies can use to provide their staff with a method to view and book available desks so that their team members know before coming to the office that they have a desk to use. A tool that allows employees to log into a website and book their desk for the day (or discover that there are none available which would allow them make other arrangements) would be beneficial to a lot of companies and their employees. By solving this problem, time will be saved, which will increase productivity and companies can adapt their resources according to the needs of their business. This has the possibility of reducing expenses and improving the bottom line profit.
